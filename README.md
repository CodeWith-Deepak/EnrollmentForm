# EnrollmentForm

This is the first enrollment form created by me, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which enters details and all other basic imformations from users that are required to create forms like name, e-mail id, website link, image link for creating profile picture and skills. It also displays all the registered forms alongside.

Finally, I'm glad to share the link of the hosted webpage which is given below. I hope that You will like it and suggest me ideas for its improvement.
